                                        <p>It is a vector vaccine based on adenovirus DNA, in which the <a href="https://www.coronavirustoday.com/sars-cov-2">SARS-CoV-2</a> coronavirus gene is integrated. Adenovirus is used as a “container” to deliver the coronavirus gene to cells and start the synthesis of the new coronavirus's envelope proteins, “introducing” the immune system to a potential enemy.</p>
                                        <p>The <a href="https://sputnikvaccine.com/">Sputnik V</a> (Gam-COVID-Vac) vaccine reduces the time taken for the actual development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the <a href="https://www.coronavirustoday.com/covid-19-disease">COVID-19</a> pandemic.</p>
                                        <p>In May 2020, a state institute, the <a href="https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-us/">Gamaleya National Research Centre</a> of Epidemiology and Microbiology, <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/russia-plans-to-start-producing-coronavirus-vaccine-in-september">announced</a> that it had developed the vaccine, which does not have any side effects. The first vaccination leads to humoral cellular immunity, and once a <a href="https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/">second vaccination</a> is administered, memory cells are formed.</p>
                                        <p>The Sputnik V vaccine was developed by the same government labs that created what is claimed as "effective against the <a href="https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/ebola-vaccines">Ebola</a> virus, as well as a vaccine against the <a href="https://www.coronavirustoday.com/mers-vaccines">MERS</a> virus.”</p>
                                        <p>On February 2, 2021, The <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00234-8/fulltext">Lancet</a> published a new study: Safety and efficacy of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine, an interim analysis of a randomized controlled phase 3 trial in Russia. This peer-reviewed article concluded the phase 3 trial of Gam-COVID-Vac showed 91.6% efficacy against COVID-19 and was well tolerated in a large cohort.</p>

This news indicates the Russian Federation became one of the first countries in the world to apply to WHO for prequalification of its vaccine against the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection.</p>
                                        <p>On November 24, 2020, positive results of the second interim analysis of <a href="https://rdif.ru/fullNews/6057/">Phase III data</a> of the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine were reported. The evaluation of efficacy was carried out among 18,794 volunteers on the 28th day after receiving the first injection (the 7th day after receiving the second injection) of the vaccine or placebo upon reaching the second checkpoint following the Clinical Study Protocol. Based on the analysis, the efficiency of Sputnik V was 95%.</p>

We welcome the beginning of a new phase of cooperation between vaccine manufacturers, intend to develop this partnership in the future, and look forward to starting co-production after the new vaccine has been demonstrated to be effective in clinical trials. We hope other vaccine manufacturers will also follow our example.'</p>
